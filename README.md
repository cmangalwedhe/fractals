# Java Interactive Fractal Viewer

This repository contains a graphical user interface (GUI) showcasing a variety of fractals.

To run the file there are two options:
- Run the .jar file in the out folder
- Run the java file in the src folder

Upon opening the program, there will be an epilepsy warning. After you click yes, you can view the fractals using the dropdown menu.

By default, the fractals will be set at 100 iterations. Using the slider on the top, you can adjust the fractal and view how the fractal develops iteration by iteration.
